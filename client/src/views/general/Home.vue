		<h3 class="home-desc">Hello World!<br><br>I am FlatMatch v2, empowered with the use of Blockchain and
			SmartContracts technologies to handle transactions securely.
			<br>
			Right now, I am just a prototype to simulate the process of smart transaction between buyers and sellers but
			in upcoming years, i shall eliminate the so called middlemen and third party organizations from the picture.
			<br>
			I extend my deepest gratitude to my creators, Kushagra Sharma, Utkarsh Shukla and Ravi Kumar gupta for
			entrusting me with this power.
			<br>
			Here are the contributions made by them individually:
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>A basic architecture of client side using vuejs</li>
				<li>Setting up the route for various pages</li>
				<li>Integrating metamask plugin to use webapp network</li>
			</ol>
			<br><br>
			Would now like to take my leave. <br>
			Regards, <br>
			FlatMatch v2
